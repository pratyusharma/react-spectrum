I want to enhance React Spectrum's Button component to support a terminal-style loading animation. Currently, the Button shows a spinner when isPending is true. I want to add an option to show a nostalgic terminal-style animation with cycling dots like 'Loading', 'Loading.', 'Loading..', 'Loading...', 'Loading....'.
    
- I want configurable settings for text, number of dots and speed of animation
- Help me think through how to break this into iterative pieces and write a plan.md

Check off items in the plan as we accomplish them as a todo list. If you have open questions that require my input, add those in the plan as well.
